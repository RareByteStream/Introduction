## Summary of Interest:

* My interest in software development and engineering comes from
  building applications and tools for myself to assist my scientific
  and analytical pursuits.
* As a developer and engineer, I define myself as **Full-Cycle**
  rather than full-stack or front-end — meaning I handle everything
  from start to finish.


  
## Languages and Platforms
* **OS:** Linux distros only. Might extend to other **open-source-from-birth** families later.
* **JavaScript:** Used with Node.js, Electron, Chromium, and Firefox for building Web, TUI, GUI, and Mobile applications and libraries.
* **OpenJDK** & **OpenJFX:** Used for the same things as **JS**, and also to learn **OOP-first** and **type-safe** development.
* **Python:** Used for the same things as **JS** and **JDK**, but with rapid prototyping and without worrying about JIT compliance or complex graphical interfaces.
* **Bash:** Used for wrapping around native utilities.
* **C** & **C++:** Used for learning and experimenting with software-engineering fundamentals when necessary.


  
## Contact Information
* If we are discussing business or are coworkers, you can use my legal name.
  Otherwise, use either my GitHub nickname or one of my GitHub names (**Alex** and/or the surname **Willer**).
  I use and respect my legal name only in formal and legal contexts.
* **Preferred Languages:** English; other Indo-European languages (can translate Indo-European languages efficiently in text).
* E-Mail Address: enesg.devel@gmail.com
